The web application was developed using Python Flask as the backend framework and HTML with Bootstrap for the front end. Python Flask is a lightweight and flexible framework that allows for easy development of web applications. It provides various features and extensions that simplify tasks such as routing, handling HTTP requests, and managing sessions.

To integrate deep learning models into the web application, we loaded CNN and VIT models into the Flask application. Flask provides an easy way to handle requests and responses, allowing us to define routes for different functionalities of the web application.

In the web application, users can upload an image through a form. The uploaded image is then processed by the CNN and VIT models to classify it into appropriate categories. The results are displayed to the user, indicating the predicted class of the image. Additionally, we used HTML and Bootstrap to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the web application. Bootstrap provides pre-defined CSS styles and components, making it easier to design a visually appealing front end.
